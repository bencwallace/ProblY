Probly is a Python package based on a simple implementation of a random variable that can be manipulated in intuitive ways.

Probly shifts the emphasis in computational statistics from **probability distributions**—typically
*functions* that can be called on to produce a concrete sample—to **random variables**—*objects* that represent the potential outcome of a sampling procedure and that can be manipulated in the same ways as these outcomes. Typically, this means that random variables are subject to the usual laws of arithmetic. This is accounted for by Probly, which approaches computational statistics from the point of view of symbolic math.
