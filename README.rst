Probly is a Python package for the simple and intuitive manipulaton of random variables.

Probly shifts the emphasis in computational statistics from **probability distributions**—typically
implemented as *functions* that can be called on to produce a concrete sample—to **random variables**—*objects* that represent the potential outcome of a sampling procedure and that can be manipulated in the same ways as these outcomes. Typically, this means that random variables are subject to the usual laws of arithmetic. This is accounted for by Probly, which approaches computational statistics from the point of view of symbolic math.
